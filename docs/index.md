In the year 2000, all I wanted, as a Black girl Radiohead fan, was to live with them out at these extremities. The woozy keyboard swirl and processed vocal gibberish of Everything in Its Right Place, the album’s opening track, announced the very opposite: all was about to be thrown thrillingly out of whack. The sublime Treefingers is a glimmering object that spins slowly around the universe; the spectacular plaintive sorrow of Motion Picture Soundtrack was an invitation to dive into a cinematic dreamscape of heartbreak. Why not live in these worlds, I thought, with the disaster of the US presidential election recount unfolding deep into the fall?

		What makes Radiohead’s music such a radical endeavour to me are these deeply introspective other worlds, built as bulwarks against the tyrannies of everyday life (a world where “we’ve got heads on sticks / you’ve got ventriloquists,” as Thom Yorke sings in nightmarishly garbled vocals on the title track). Kid A’s recurring lyrical insistence on “slipping away” is nothing new to rock masculinity, an anxious nod to the stubborn will to “not fade” dating back to the genre’s earliest days. But it is also a gorgeous, revolutionary invitation to exist in an elsewhere, in a way that resonates with what scholars often refer to as the Black Radical tradition in music.

Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity – and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote misattributed to Gandhi, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.

How many combinations of unintended consequences and human reactions to them does it take to detour us into a future that seems to defy any obvious trend? Not many. That’s why predicting the future accurately is so difficult. Some of the most mistaken predictions I’ve seen are of the straight-line variety–that’s the kind that ignores the inevitability of unintended consequences, ignores our often less-than-logical reactions to them, and says simply, “In the future, we will have more and more of whatever’s holding our attention right now.” If we’re in a period of prosperity, then in the future, prosperity it will be. If we’re in a period of recession, we’re doomed to even greater distress. Of course, predicting an impossible state of permanent prosperity may well be an act of fear and superstitious hope rather than an act of unimaginative, straight-line thinking. And predicting doom in difficult times may have more to do with the sorrow and depression of the moment than with any real insight into future possibilities. Superstition, depression and fear play major roles in our efforts at prediction.
(…) So why try to predict the future at all if it’s so difficult, so nearly impossible? Because making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting in dangerous directions. Because prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer, wiser courses. Because, most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our today. Through thought and deed, we exert a great deal of influence over this child, even though we can’t control it absolutely. Best to think about it, though. Best to try to shape it into something good. Best to do that for any child.

The problem with all forms of expertise in public policy is that it is often the most formidable salespeople who claim greater certainty than the evidence allows who are invited to jet around the world advising governments. But the irony for behavioural scientists is that this is a product of them trading off, and falling prey to, the very biases they have made their names calling out.
I can only imagine how easy it might have been for Johnson to succumb to confirmation bias in looking for reasons to delay a lockdown: what prime minister wants to shut down the economy? And it is the optimism bias of the behavioural tsars that has led them to place too much stock in their own judgment in a world of limited evidence. But this isn’t some experiment in a university psychology department - it is a pandemic and lives are at stake.

“Pero no es que el sistema esté roto es que funciona así”, nos recuerda Carlos Fernández Liria: “El capitalismo no genera ocio, sino paro, que no es lo mismo. Paro y trabajo excesivo; pero de repartir nada, porque económicamente es imposible, la economía se pondría enferma con ese reparto”, así que entre la economía y nosotros, el sistema prefiere que enfermemos nosotros. 
Esto lo corrobora la OMS cuando nos recuerda que cada año se suicidan unas 800 000 personas en el mundo y que la pobreza, el desempleo y las condiciones precarias de trabajo son sus principales responsables. Sorprende entonces, que la misma organización sugiera como soluciones parchecitos baratos como el ejercicio físico, los programas de prevención en las escuelas, la terapia y la medicación. La investigadora Noelle Sulivan pregunta, muy pertinentemente, si la pobreza y el paro son las principales causas de depresión, “¿No deberían nuestros remedios abordar los motores económicos de la pobreza y el desempleo en lugar de centrarse específicamente en programas escolares y ejercicio?” Y yo añadiría ¿en qué momento vamos a abordar los verdaderos factores que condicionan los problemas de salud mental?

VIII. O que é o socialismo? Para muitos marxistas é a transformação das relações de produção – através da apropriação coletiva dos meios de produção – para permitir o livre desenvolvimento das forças produtivas. O ecossocialismo se reivindica de Marx, mas rompe explicitamente com este modelo produtivista. É claro que a apropriação coletiva é indispensável, mas as próprias forças produtivas também devem ser radicalmente transformadas: a) mudando suas fontes de energia (renováveis ao invés de combustíveis fósseis); b) reduzindo o consumo global de energia; c) reduzindo (“decrescimento”) a produção de bens e eliminando atividades desnecessárias (publicidade) e pragas (pesticidas, armas de guerra); d) pondo um fim à obsolescência programada. O ecossocialismo também implica a transformação dos padrões de consumo, das formas de transporte, do planejamento urbano, do modo de vida. Em suma, é muito mais do que uma mudança nas formas de propriedade: é uma mudança civilizacional, baseada em valores de solidariedade, igualdade-liberdade (egaliberté) e respeito pela natureza. A civilização ecossocialista rompe com o produtivismo e o consumismo para favorecer a redução do tempo de trabalho e, portanto, a extensão do tempo livre dedicado a atividades sociais, políticas, lúdicas, artísticas, eróticas, etc., etc. Marx chamou este objetivo de o “Reino da Liberdade”.[…]
XIII. Temos chance de ganhar esta batalha antes que seja tarde demais? Ao contrário dos pretensos “colapssólogos”, que proclamam em alto e bom som que a catástrofe é inevitável e que qualquer resistência é inútil, nós acreditamos que o futuro permanece aberto. Não há garantia de que este futuro seja ecossocialista: é objeto de uma aposta no sentido de Pascal, na qual se engaja todas as forças em “trabalhar para a incerteza”. Mas, como disse Bertolt Brecht, com grande e simples sabedoria: “Aquele que luta pode perder. Aquele que não luta já perdeu”.

Compared to carrying coal by rail, moving oil by sea eliminated the labour of coal heavers and stokers, and thus the power of organised workers to withdraw their labour from a critical point in the energy system. Transoceanic shipping operated beyond the territorial spaces governed by the labour regulations and other democratic rights won in the era of widespread coal and railway strikes. In fact shipping companies could escape the regulation of labour laws altogether - as well as the payment of taxes - by registering their vessels in Panama or under other ‘flags of convenience’, removing whatever limited powers of labour organising might have remained. (…) The *Torrey Canyon*, an oil tanker owned by a Bermuda-based subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California, registered in Liberia, chartered to BP, built in 1959 and rebuilt in 1966 in a Japanese shipyard to increase her size from 66,000 to 119,000 deadweight tons, ran aground off the coast of Cornwall, England, in March 1967. The tanker had set sail without knowing her final destination, and lacked detailed navigation charts for the coast of south-west England. The damage to the coastline and to wildlife was exacerbated by the lack of methods to handle large oil spills. The British government tried to set fire to the oil by having air defence forces bomb it with napalm, creating further damage and inadvertently revealing both their possession of the controversial weapon and the inaccuracy of the bombers (more than a quarter of the bombs missed their target). **Timothy Mitchell - Carbon Democracy, 2015 - page 38**

It can be difficult to work out quite what exactly it is about the past that so many in Morrissey’s generation long for. It certainly isn’t council housing, full employment, free education, public ownership or social mobility, because if these are noted at all, it’s in the context of decrying the Labour Party’s foolish utopianism in trying to resurrect them.
What it is, is a nostalgia for misery, a longing for boredom, a relocation of poverty from economics to aesthetics. The belligerent ghouls. The spineless bastards. The beatings. The ignorance. The pollution and the soot. The gay-bashing and the paki-bashing. The murders on the Moors. The young are not only resented for not having suffered these, the obsessive recall of them is a way of constantly re-living an experience of personal struggle and uprooting, an origin story for home ownership and bored affluence, whether that’s the pettier example of the paid-off mortgage or the purchased council house, or in Morrissey’s case, the villa in the hills of LA. And who stands in the way of this self-aggrandisement through re-enactment? The Asians, especially the Muslims. The young. The left. The “woke”. And here, Morrissey is truly the voice of a generation.
