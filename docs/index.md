In the year 2000, all I wanted, as a Black girl Radiohead fan, was to live with them out at these extremities. The woozy keyboard swirl and processed vocal gibberish of Everything in Its Right Place, the album’s opening track, announced the very opposite: all was about to be thrown thrillingly out of whack. The sublime Treefingers is a glimmering object that spins slowly around the universe; the spectacular plaintive sorrow of Motion Picture Soundtrack was an invitation to dive into a cinematic dreamscape of heartbreak. Why not live in these worlds, I thought, with the disaster of the US presidential election recount unfolding deep into the fall?

What makes Radiohead’s music such a radical endeavour to me are these deeply introspective other worlds, built as bulwarks against the tyrannies of everyday life (a world where “we’ve got heads on sticks / you’ve got ventriloquists,” as Thom Yorke sings in nightmarishly garbled vocals on the title track). Kid A’s recurring lyrical insistence on “slipping away” is nothing new to rock masculinity, an anxious nod to the stubborn will to “not fade” dating back to the genre’s earliest days. But it is also a gorgeous, revolutionary invitation to exist in an elsewhere, in a way that resonates with what scholars often refer to as the Black Radical tradition in music.

Before protest there is a oppression, lack of popular support, and the hard work of awareness-raising. After that comes the high-octane action, the moral clarity – and allies hop on board. But once the first blood rush of protest subsides, the people who are still on the streets are mocked by their erstwhile allies, impatient to find fault with the movement and get back to their lives without any further disruption. What was universally celebrated a few weeks ago is now faintly embarrassing: too radical, too combative, almost comically unrealistic. You might think of the trajectory of the Black Lives Matter protests so far as like that famous quote misattributed to Gandhi, but this time in reverse: first you win, then they fight you, then they laugh at you, then they ignore you.

How many combinations of unintended consequences and human reactions to them does it take to detour us into a future that seems to defy any obvious trend? Not many. That’s why predicting the future accurately is so difficult. Some of the most mistaken predictions I’ve seen are of the straight-line variety–that’s the kind that ignores the inevitability of unintended consequences, ignores our often less-than-logical reactions to them, and says simply, “In the future, we will have more and more of whatever’s holding our attention right now.” If we’re in a period of prosperity, then in the future, prosperity it will be. If we’re in a period of recession, we’re doomed to even greater distress. Of course, predicting an impossible state of permanent prosperity may well be an act of fear and superstitious hope rather than an act of unimaginative, straight-line thinking. And predicting doom in difficult times may have more to do with the sorrow and depression of the moment than with any real insight into future possibilities. Superstition, depression and fear play major roles in our efforts at prediction.

(…) So why try to predict the future at all if it’s so difficult, so nearly impossible? Because making predictions is one way to give warning when we see ourselves drifting in dangerous directions. Because prediction is a useful way of pointing out safer, wiser courses. Because, most of all, our tomorrow is the child of our today. Through thought and deed, we exert a great deal of influence over this child, even though we can’t control it absolutely. Best to think about it, though. Best to try to shape it into something good. Best to do that for any child.

The problem with all forms of expertise in public policy is that it is often the most formidable salespeople who claim greater certainty than the evidence allows who are invited to jet around the world advising governments. But the irony for behavioural scientists is that this is a product of them trading off, and falling prey to, the very biases they have made their names calling out.

I can only imagine how easy it might have been for Johnson to succumb to confirmation bias in looking for reasons to delay a lockdown: what prime minister wants to shut down the economy? And it is the optimism bias of the behavioural tsars that has led them to place too much stock in their own judgment in a world of limited evidence. But this isn’t some experiment in a university psychology department - it is a pandemic and lives are at stake.

“Pero no es que el sistema esté roto es que funciona así”, nos recuerda Carlos Fernández Liria: “El capitalismo no genera ocio, sino paro, que no es lo mismo. Paro y trabajo excesivo; pero de repartir nada, porque económicamente es imposible, la economía se pondría enferma con ese reparto”, así que entre la economía y nosotros, el sistema prefiere que enfermemos nosotros.

Esto lo corrobora la OMS cuando nos recuerda que cada año se suicidan unas 800 000 personas en el mundo y que la pobreza, el desempleo y las condiciones precarias de trabajo son sus principales responsables. Sorprende entonces, que la misma organización sugiera como soluciones parchecitos baratos como el ejercicio físico, los programas de prevención en las escuelas, la terapia y la medicación. La investigadora Noelle Sulivan pregunta, muy pertinentemente, si la pobreza y el paro son las principales causas de depresión, “¿No deberían nuestros remedios abordar los motores económicos de la pobreza y el desempleo en lugar de centrarse específicamente en programas escolares y ejercicio?” Y yo añadiría ¿en qué momento vamos a abordar los verdaderos factores que condicionan los problemas de salud mental?

VIII. O que é o socialismo? Para muitos marxistas é a transformação das relações de produção – através da apropriação coletiva dos meios de produção – para permitir o livre desenvolvimento das forças produtivas. O ecossocialismo se reivindica de Marx, mas rompe explicitamente com este modelo produtivista. É claro que a apropriação coletiva é indispensável, mas as próprias forças produtivas também devem ser radicalmente transformadas: a) mudando suas fontes de energia (renováveis ao invés de combustíveis fósseis); b) reduzindo o consumo global de energia; c) reduzindo (“decrescimento”) a produção de bens e eliminando atividades desnecessárias (publicidade) e pragas (pesticidas, armas de guerra); d) pondo um fim à obsolescência programada. O ecossocialismo também implica a transformação dos padrões de consumo, das formas de transporte, do planejamento urbano, do modo de vida. Em suma, é muito mais do que uma mudança nas formas de propriedade: é uma mudança civilizacional, baseada em valores de solidariedade, igualdade-liberdade (egaliberté) e respeito pela natureza. A civilização ecossocialista rompe com o produtivismo e o consumismo para favorecer a redução do tempo de trabalho e, portanto, a extensão do tempo livre dedicado a atividades sociais, políticas, lúdicas, artísticas, eróticas, etc., etc. Marx chamou este objetivo de o “Reino da Liberdade”.

(…) XIII. Temos chance de ganhar esta batalha antes que seja tarde demais? Ao contrário dos pretensos “colapssólogos”, que proclamam em alto e bom som que a catástrofe é inevitável e que qualquer resistência é inútil, nós acreditamos que o futuro permanece aberto. Não há garantia de que este futuro seja ecossocialista: é objeto de uma aposta no sentido de Pascal, na qual se engaja todas as forças em “trabalhar para a incerteza”. Mas, como disse Bertolt Brecht, com grande e simples sabedoria: “Aquele que luta pode perder. Aquele que não luta já perdeu”.

Compared to carrying coal by rail, moving oil by sea eliminated the labour of coal heavers and stokers, and thus the power of organised workers to withdraw their labour from a critical point in the energy system. Transoceanic shipping operated beyond the territorial spaces governed by the labour regulations and other democratic rights won in the era of widespread coal and railway strikes. In fact shipping companies could escape the regulation of labour laws altogether - as well as the payment of taxes - by registering their vessels in Panama or under other ‘flags of convenience’, removing whatever limited powers of labour organising might have remained.

(…) The *Torrey Canyon*, an oil tanker owned by a Bermuda-based subsidiary of the Union Oil Company of California, registered in Liberia, chartered to BP, built in 1959 and rebuilt in 1966 in a Japanese shipyard to increase her size from 66,000 to 119,000 deadweight tons, ran aground off the coast of Cornwall, England, in March 1967. The tanker had set sail without knowing her final destination, and lacked detailed navigation charts for the coast of south-west England. The damage to the coastline and to wildlife was exacerbated by the lack of methods to handle large oil spills. The British government tried to set fire to the oil by having air defence forces bomb it with napalm, creating further damage and inadvertently revealing both their possession of the controversial weapon and the inaccuracy of the bombers (more than a quarter of the bombs missed their target).

It can be difficult to work out quite what exactly it is about the past that so many in Morrissey’s generation long for. It certainly isn’t council housing, full employment, free education, public ownership or social mobility, because if these are noted at all, it’s in the context of decrying the Labour Party’s foolish utopianism in trying to resurrect them.

What it is, is a nostalgia for misery, a longing for boredom, a relocation of poverty from economics to aesthetics. The belligerent ghouls. The spineless bastards. The beatings. The ignorance. The pollution and the soot. The gay-bashing and the paki-bashing. The murders on the Moors. The young are not only resented for not having suffered these, the obsessive recall of them is a way of constantly re-living an experience of personal struggle and uprooting, an origin story for home ownership and bored affluence, whether that’s the pettier example of the paid-off mortgage or the purchased council house, or in Morrissey’s case, the villa in the hills of LA. And who stands in the way of this self-aggrandisement through re-enactment? The Asians, especially the Muslims. The young. The left. The “woke”. And here, Morrissey is truly the voice of a generation.

Taken together, one message is clear: “The coronavirus is NOT the great equalizer.” With this in mind, many people are calling for more data on the disproportionate rates of infection and death among poor and racialized groups. And while I tend to support more data collection, I want to offer a caution. The facts alone will not save us.

According to a recent study on criminal justice reform out of Stanford, researchers demonstrated that “Using statistics to inform the public about racial disparities can backfire. Worse yet, it can cause some people to be more supportive of the policies that create those inequalities.” In other words, two people can see the same headline, “Black People Make up 40 percent of Covid-19 deaths in Michigan,” and come to very different conclusions! In fact, that is exactly what is happening.

Exhibit B: The US Surgeon General singled out Blacks and Latinos to urge “no drinking or smoking” as a preventative measure during the pandemic, which plays into a long history of government officials invoking the supposedly bad behavior of  racialized groups as the reason for their hardship. We see it with the very different responses to Black and White drug use, one is a crime and the other is a public health emergency.

The “culture of poverty” script is a reliable alibi that lets the bad behavior of powerful institutions off the hook, and goes back to at least the Moynihan Report in which Black women, in particular, are blamed for the so-called disfunctions of Black families and communities.

RS: I think we have a political duty not to use it [social media] to vent, not to use it to write, and not to allow it to harness our personal relations, and we also have a duty to save as much of our free time as possible from being captured by capital. I don’t want to take a moralising tone, but it’s similar to the duty to take your life seriously. If you take your life seriously, and take an overview of it, it’s pretty hard to justify the things we allow ourselves to do all the time. It’s not like anyone’s pure, and I’m not in a position to offer anyone salvation, I’m just saying that if you can do something else with those 50,000 hours of your life, and can use it in a professional way…

The self-made man: the man for whom we have to pretend we do not feel, do not need, is, as Hopper describes him, ‘simultaneously entitled, dismissive, and hard to get.’

Emerson believed that emotional dependence is the birthplace of shame. There is shame in being an object of empathy, he thought. There is shame in capitulating to requests for help.

A man ought to be able to withstand any degree of pain without the need to be soothed.

Reading this, I realised that Emerson’s self-made male archetype had seeped into my own belief system. Ever since I can remember, I have been convinced that there is shame not only in watching another person capitulate to my requests for help, but that there is shame in making the request at all.
In my romantic life, I learned not to ask for help because I knew, without ever being told, that in all likelihood the men sitting opposite me would see this as weakness.

With social media addiction, there are many more variables than with drugs, so it is hard to know where to begin. The designers of the smartphone or tablet interface, for example, have made sure that it is pleasurable to engage with, hold, or even just to look at. The urge to reach, irritably, for the device during meals, conversations, parties and upon awakening, can partly be attributed to lust for the object and the soft, nacreous glow of the screen. Once we have navigated to the app, it is the platform designers who take control. For the duration of our visit, life is briefly streamlined, as with a video game, into a single visual flow, a set of soluble challenges, some dangled rewards and a game of chance. But the variety of possible experiences include voyeurism, approval and disapproval, gaming, news, nostalgia, socialising and regular social comparisons. If we are addicted, we might just be addicted to the activities that the platforms enable, from gambling to shopping to spying on “friends”.

The platforms don’t organise our experience according to a masterplan. As the sociologist Benjamin Bratton puts it, the mechanism is “strict and invariable”, but within that “autocracy of means”, the user is granted a relative “liberty of ends”. The protocols of the platform standardise and order the interactions of users. They use incentives and choke points to keep people committed to the machine. They manipulate ends for the benefit of their real clients – other firms. They bombard us with stimuli, learning from our responses, the better to teach us how to be the market demographic we have been identified as. But they do not force us to stay there, or tell us what to do with the hours spent on the platform. Even more so than in the case of drugs, then, the toxicity is something we as users bring to the game.

Standard London millennial stuff = Millennials. Ah. That word. That concept. I find the obsession with generational divide – and actually assigning each tribe a name like being born at the same time makes you a homogeneous mass – and the ensuing culture war really really tiresome and lazy. It is a middle-class obsession. Plenty of people out there, of every generation, are experiencing the same problems, usually heightened because they have less money, no social mobility, suffer from prejudice and, most tragically, lack the contact email address of an opinion columns editor. Breaking news: people of all ages are being absolutely screwed by society – screaming about avocados, mortgages, and numbers on a birth certificate isn’t helpful, it’s a distraction. Can you all even hear yourselves?

Agricultural expansion depended not upon the settling of America, but on continuous and fitful cycles of dispossession, settling, unsettling, and resettling. Nineteenth-century populations were highly mobile, and they often carved out ecologies and communities that were precarious, fragile, and intentionally temporary. Many farmers planted on a particular plot of land always with an eye on the exit: the fantasy of cheap, fertile land out West. Others went West, and when they found it, immediately fled back East in shock.

For the millions of slaves laboring in Southern agriculture, the notion of permanent settlement ran afoul of the stark realities implicit in the traffic of souls: Slavers sold their slaves to cover debts, to hedge declining labor productivity as slaves aged, to dispose of difficult or rebellious slaves, and for a thousand other reasons. The movements of individual slaves often demonstrated a complex pattern not of settlement and permanence, but of internal flow, migration, and transience that follows precisely the trajectory of cotton cultivation: southwest and downriver. For indigenous populations, the history of agricultural expansion was the history of repeated dispossession and forced resettlement on increasingly marginal lands.

3:AM: You’ve said recently of *London* that “It’s a joke about a man who thinks he’d be happier if London was more like Paris.”  
PK: In the 1990s, especially in the early years of the Labour government, there was a widespread view that London would be a much better place if it could become more like a European city. Richard Rogers, especially in the post-1997 context of the Urban Task Force, and the Architecture Foundation, co-founded by Ricky Burdett, who later became a kind of architectural fixer for the capital, were among the leaders of this tendency, and the peak of its influence was probably in 1999, when the RIBA awarded its Royal Gold Medal not to an architect, but to the city of Barcelona. When Pasqual Maragall came to accept the award, he made a speech in which he compared London under Thatcher to Spain under Franco. In the end, however, the Barcelonaisation of London seems to have consisted of a few landmark buildings, notably Tate Modern, the refurbishment of Trafalgar Square, the Jubilee Line extension, a lot of restaurants, and phenomena such as the gentrification of now-fashionable mid-20th century public-sector housing developments and the annual London Festival of Architecture. London has been equipped with the kind of culture that makes life tolerable for educated international bankers, but the revival of urbanism that Rogers and his milieu continue to argue for has not really progressed very far, other than in contexts such as the Olympic Games: ‘High Street 2012’, for example. Instead the city was thrown open to international finance, and has become notorious for its extraordinary economic inequality. It is surprising how many artists and other creative types formerly associated with London now live elsewhere, usually in places where space is cheaper, and everyday life much easier to enjoy.

Today, the [Irish] landscape is greener than it has ever been. Much of the country is an expanse of bright fields of monoculture rye grass which is grazed by millions of cows. There is nothing natural about this vivid shade of green. It is, quite literally, artificial – the result of the application of chemical nitrogen fertiliser. Far from being an indicator of intrinsic fertility, the green of Ireland’s fields today is distinctly unnatural.

If today’s glossy green is the result of man-made chemicals, does the Irish landscape have a ‘natural’ colour palette? Can we imagine the land before humans exerted such a strong influence on its form and appearance?

Compilation literature—I’m using a term invented by the Byzantinist Catherine Holmes here—is produced by copying, summarizing, reordering, updating, and excerpting pre-existing material, and shaping these materials to fit the author-compiler’s current situation or eventual goal. Byzantine compilation literature spans genres: military handbooks, agriculture, hagiography, medicine, law, moralizing literature, and dream interpretation are all locations where we can see Byzantine authors employing these methods. The sheer predominance of compilation literature suggests that it was highly efficacious for Byzantine persons—that producing texts in this way was productive, solved problems, was useful and effective.

“Well never see bison roaming the entire Great Plains again,” said Proctor. “We’ll never see 20 million to 30 million bison again. No one is trying to go back in time. We’re trying to go forward. We’re trying to restore this important animal where we can, where people want them, and to the level where they will help restore the natural balance.”
For any of this to happen, Native American tribes will be key. They have the land and the desire to bring back the continent’s largest land mammal. And it’s not just bison, Proctor said. They have been instrumental in conserving wolves, grizzly bears, swift foxes and black-footed ferrets among other species.

«D’une manière générale, faire pipi et caca dans l’eau n’est pas une bonne idée. Toute la richesse du produit se retrouve complètement diluée au départ et cela pose problème pour la récupérer après», précise Bruno Tassin, directeur de thèse de Fabien Esculier et membre d’OCAPI. Sans compter l’énergie et les frais pour traiter les eaux usées en aval. C’est pourquoi le programme de recherche planche sur une séparation des excréments à la source. Urine d’un côté, matière fécale de l’autre. Façon aussi de limiter les contaminations.

«L’urine est très peu facteur de maladies alors qu’au contraire les matières fécales sont le support de la transmission du choléra, de la gastro-entérite etc. Les seuls systèmes à la fois circulaires et salubres sont ceux qui séparent urine et matière fécale», détaille Fabien Esculier. Pour abattre résidus médicamenteux ou germes de l’urine, une solution consiste à faire reposer le liquide. Lors du stockage, le pH élevé et l’ammoniaque détruisent les molécules indésirables. C’est ce que recommande l’OMS, qui s’est penchée sur la façon dont utiliser sans risque les urines et matières fécales en agriculture.

Even Jimmy Emmons, who seems about as self-assured as a farmer can be, acknowledged that he doesn’t even go to his local coffee shop anymore. If he did, he’d hear disapproval from his fellow farmers for doing things like planting his wheat directly into a living stand of plant residue without tilling or grazing his animals on cover crops.
On one panel at the conference, for instance, Adam Chappell responded to a comment made about the science of monoculture by saying, “There is no scientific evidence of the benefit of monoculture, but there is plenty of propaganda. The salesmen tell me constantly that I’m stupid, or that I’ll go broke” because he’s using fewer inputs.

Tuning out those messages, he added, has become a lot easier thanks to the network of other no-till farmers he stays in touch with online—Twitter and YouTube are popular platforms for sharing photos, observations, and videos of one another’s farms—and at conferences like No-till in the Plains.

In other words, namaste, as it circulates today, within global news media, its stock images, and associated pop culture trends like yoga tourism, functions as a controlling image. And so, as my Uber driver clearly demonstrated to me, it is easily weaponized as a slur. In this light, the interdependence of white paternalism and popular culture in the U.S. explodes the notion that namaste, as it appears in our daily lives today, is somehow innocuous, much less inclusive.

(…) « La prétendue crise des déchets n’était pas une crise, continue-t-il. Car le problème ne vient pas des déchets domestiques, mais des déchets industriels : pour vous donner un ordre de grandeur, on estime que l’Italie produit annuellement 30 millions de tonnes de déchets domestiques, et 135 millions de tonnes de déchets industriels… Or, le problème, c’est que les chiffres des déchets domestiques sont crédibles, tandis que ceux des déchets industriels reposent sur de simples déclarations ». Le militant cite l’exemple de Calvi Risorta, dans la province de Caserte, où l’entreprise, Pozzi Ginori, qui faisait des salles de bains et des carrelages et utilisait des solvants et des colorants, avait pris l’habitude d’enterrer ses déchets sur les lieux mêmes de l’usine. « Ils ont empoisonné 2 millions de mètres cubes de terre.

The word Barthes uses is *délicatesse* - a beautiful sequence of syllables to walk through the mouth. A decisive principle of the oeuvre, writes Tiphanie Samoyault, *délicatesse* is ‘the contrary of arrogance’ and another name for what Barthes called ‘the neutral’. But where the neutral is imagined as a utopia (in grammar, the neutral or neuter is neither masculine nor feminine, neither active nor passive; in politics, Barthes sees it as a refusal to take sides on complex conflictual questions phrased in such a way as to permit only yes/no answers), *délicatesse* is the name given to the small-scale, everyday practice of values such as goodwill and attentiveness, what Barthes also calls ‘sweetness’ (*la douceur*), values in the form of behaviours that parry the already decided, the apparent self-evidence, the all-purpose explanation - and attend to those small, fleeting and fragile moments in life where, as Samoyault puts it, ‘individuals truly express themselves in their truth’.

The salient point remains that after the Reformation much of late Tudor London was in a ruined condition, with walls and gateways and ancient stone windows to be glimpsed among the shops and houses which lined the lanes and thoroughfares. Even in the area outside the walls, where the palaces of the bishops and nobles had led down from the Strand towards the river, the grand houses were, according to the Venetian ambassador, ‘disfigured by the ruins of a multitude of churches and monasteries’.

I’m a wildlife biologist. Decades ago, I visited a team working to restore streamsides churned to bare gravel by placer mining. They were planting willow and alder in hopes of stabilizing the banks and preventing further erosion. Other vegetation could then move in and once again shade the passing waters, cooling them for native trout and spawning salmon. I was already picturing songbirds returning to nest in the lush foliage while mink, otters, and bears patrolled the shores, except the normally hardy willow and alder wouldn’t grow. They withered instead, and the banks stayed empty — until the team prepared the next batch to be planted by first soaking their roots in a broth containing certain fungi. This is common practice today. It wasn’t then. Besides changing the way I’ve planted trees at home ever since, the visit made me realize that my view of the most important wildlife in ecosystems might be upside-down.

(…) Ten to 20 percent of the sugars a plant produces through photosynthesis are absorbed by the mycorrhizae. In return, the fungus delivers many essential nutrients to the plant and increases drought resistance. Higher crop yields can be the result for gardeners. As the ends of the hyphae weave among soil particles via cracks and crannies too small for even the narrowest root hair, the mycelium becomes an auxiliary root system that’s in contact with a subterranean volume of soil from several hundred to 2,500 times greater than what the plant could reach alone.

(…) Although we think of fungi being most at home in deep, dank forests, they’re surprisingly abundant in open shrublands and prairies, too. The outer walls of hyphae contain gluey compounds that cause fine particles of earth to clump together on and around the threads. This process is a major factor in building soil structure and making the ground less vulnerable to erosion. Mycelial networks also play a valuable role in sequestering carbon within microclusters of filaments. They limit their partner plants’ exposure to heavy metals, such as lead, zinc and cadmium, by keeping those elements bound to the hyphae’s sticky sheath. At high latitudes and high altitudes, mycorrhizal fungi scrounge nutrients from cold, rocky soils. In boggy regions, the hyphae buffer plant partners from the high acid content of peaty soils. In saline ground, the hyphae help safeguard their partners from high salt concentrations. Mycorrhizae can also protect plants from pests and diseases.

The elite of Paris writers haven’t accepted Guène into their fold. She’s not alone in feeling that France’s stilted, hidebound literary scene badly needs “new blood”. But she thinks the literary establishment still believes the suburbs and poor people are “not noble or interesting enough to belong to literature or fiction”. It’s fine for people from the high-rises to play football, or rap but the idea of intellectuals existing there is still taboo. Oddly, considering her huge international success, she hasn’t won any prizes in France, just small informal awards voted by young people and readers. Does she think that will change? “The big prizes? Are you crazy? Never, never in my life will I get a prize. That would mean recognising that what I write is literature, that there are intellectuals in the banlieues. That’s where nothing’s changing and the neo-colonialist vision comes in to play … the idea that the ‘natives’ can do sport, sing and dance but not think.”

Most of her subjects, who often describe themselves as Afro-Russians, had grown up without much contact with other black people or with little of the shared culture and identity familiar to African-Americans and black Britons. “The amount we know about our African heritage varies from individual to individual,” says Johnson Artur. What they do have in common however, is a history of struggle against a commonly encountered resistance to the presence of black people in Russia. “Those who grew up and live in Russia still have to justify on a daily basis the fact that they are Russians too.” Johnson Artur hopes her project will go some to connecting and making visible the generation of black Russians that have grown up calling the country home.

It is apparent that the Arab cinema industry has no qualms about practising Arab-washing, following in the footsteps of Hollywood and its penchant for whitewashing stories and characters.

But while in the US the use of blackface has been largely phased out, in Arab cinema it is constantly used in order to have non-black Arabs cast in black roles. They often don blackface, put on exaggerated fake buttocks, thick Afro curly hair and bright-red lipstick.

It is also indicative that for decades the first and only dark-skinned actor who played leading roles in Egyptian cinema was Ahmed Zaki (1949- 2005). But even he did not escape racial characterisation: He was nicknamed the “Bronze Star” and the “Black Tiger”.

He called this “the pleasure at being the cause,” and time and research have shown that is elemental to human happiness.

However, as the long process of compulsory purchase, eviction and demolition was under way, between 1890 and 1895, it became clear that no philanthropic company was willing to come forward. And so, very reluctantly, the home secretary permitted the LCC to construct the dwellings, on the understanding that these would quickly be sold on to the charitable sector. The LCC was not to act as a landlord. Antipathy towards state intervention in housing was put most colourfully in Parliament by the member for Portsmouth, who told the house that such a thing was “monstrous”, and that “if such a principle were admitted, I do not know where it will stop. The next demand made of Parliament might be to provide clothing, if not carriages and horses, for the poor”.

And it may surprise you to learn – given the obloquy that subsequently descended on these planners’ fancies – that they [aerial walkways] worked.  One resident recalls a trip to the local shops – along those walkways – taking hours to complete as she stopped to talk to everyone she met, and she knew nearly everyone.  The corridors were also a place to meet and socialise; doors left unlocked with children playing in one flat but regularly checked on by neighbours.

This was true, apparently, even of the now reviled tower blocks.  People met in lifts and on landings. Fiona, my guide to the estate, living then in Aragon Tower, remembers a close and friendly community – ‘you could knock on any door’ – and recalls too how scrupulously tenants maintained the common areas according to a rota issued by the estate caretaker.

(…) If you know the Pepys Estate or its sometime reputation, you’ll know there’s one other thing I haven’t mentioned – race.  The Estate was in its early years and for some time an almost exclusively white estate, this the result of a more or less formal policy operated by the GLC.  As one former council housing officer describes”

“It wasn’t as simple as ‘We don’t want black people living there’.  It was more like an assumption that black and white would rather live separately from one another.  So, as you go down the Old Kent Road you can see some estates are white and others are black or mixed. It didn’t happen by accident. Housing officers just didn’t allocate black people to [the Pepys Estate].”

But caution about the potential of our cities and suburbs as wildlife habitat is probably still a good idea. One danger is that these landscapes may become “ecological sinks” — that is, places where excess individuals from undisturbed habitat can survive, but not ultimately increase. Having straw-headed bulbuls in central Singapore does not, for instance, ensure survival of the species. Success with some more visible species may also blind us to broader but less obvious declines in other species. European rewilding, for instance, has not been rewilding for its insect population.

Small grains are “cool season” crops that are planted in the spring and provide coverage for the soil in the wet months, reducing erosion and soaking up excess nutrients that might otherwise end up in waterways. And since they’re harvested in July, farmers can then plant warm-season cover crops in the summer that develop robust root systems. This helps the soil function as a vital living ecosystem that retains more water, stores more carbon, and requires less fertilizer to grow food.

(…) First you have to set up a basic national building authority, then draw up a national document on house building, working on the Parker Morris standards of the 1960s. Morris created “Homes for Today and Tomorrow”, which was an absolutely remarkable adventure into housing. It meant housing could be flexible, with a range of designs; it encouraged experiment. We need a new version of this. These building standards would be used by local authorities, who would build the houses.

The very sobriety of Georgian architecture, meanwhile, is what has made it so commercially expedient. Flat walls of yellow brick and simple grids of windows mean it can fill any plot of land and allow for endless repetition, while the general flimsiness can be hidden behind signifiers of permanence and solidity. Its easy negotiation of building codes and its suitability to historically sensitive areas has made it indispensable to developers, too, so it’s easy to see why this often shoddily built pastiche rubbish has become so endemic.

A cynical view of Crowdtap is that it’s just another form of social media marketing — people being paid to tell their friends to buy things. But then you realize that these people don’t have large social media followings (in fact, Crowdtap users I interviewed said they create throwaway social media accounts to use exclusively for Crowdtap). And sharing content on social media isn’t even required — the default option is to share, but you get your points either way. Crowdtap passes members’ responses on to brands, but otherwise nobody is listening to what they say. No one is responding. There’s very little about this that might be called social. Imagine someone wandering alone in a giant desert, shouting “I love Big Macs!” into the sky. That’s Crowdtap.

Another critic of the crackdown is Dr. Ugo Rossi, a geographer at the University of Turin and author of the book Cities in Global Capitalism. He points out that the law is a response to fundamental changes to the underlying character of Italian city centers. “It’s a structural problem” Rossi says, “one that is particularly evident in Rome and other tourist-dominated cities.” Thanks to the deregulation of the housing market and the rise of home-sharing services like Airbnb, the hearts of many historic Italian towns have become increasingly oriented towards tourist accommodation and businesses, “emptying” them of local residents. “What increasingly replaces them are tourists—or in cities such as Bologna, students—who are not respectful of public space,” says Rossi. “As a result city centers are now just places of consumption rather than residency—ones that are no longer used by local people.”

Not all cities suffer equally from residential displacement, however. “The city centers that have survived this kind of transformation are those in southern Italy’s major cities, such as Naples, Palermo, Bari” says Rossi, “where despite some touristification many people are still living in the city core. So reflexes like [the Daspo Urbano] are on the one hand related to anxieties about security, and on the other about fears of a loss of authenticity, or local people who are more protective of their environment.”

Baker had opportunities in France that a black woman did not have in segregated US society and she did not have to deal with the daily outrage of a color line. At the same time the French and European obsession with Baker’s ‘primitivism’, which she played into with her famous banana dance, spoke to a racism magnetized by the erotic possibilities of blacks. In the twilight of European colonialism she symbolized the elusive native, the one who sang, danced, and tantalized but remained independent. Emerging half-naked on stage from a giant cage, Baker capitalized on barely-repressed European racial fantasies and turned them into a personal fortune. As she said, “Leers and dirty looks are two sides of the same coin.”

The African American world paid close attention to Baker and the Revue Négre as they conquered Paris. W.E.B Du Bois took note of her in The Crisis and the African American press chronicled her successes. Middle-class white Americans, few of whom had ever seen Baker perform during her US career, knew of Baker but paid her little more than brief attention. It was in Europe where Baker had the most profound impact as the American image of the Jazz Age. Two Americans especially mattered to Europeans in the 1920s: Woodrow Wilson and Josephine Baker.

The [Department of Energy] has a program, for example, to provide low-interest loans to companies to encourage risky corporate innovation in alternative energy and energy efficiency. The loan program became infamous when one of its borrowers, the solar-energy company Solyndra, was unable to repay its loan, but, as a whole, since its inception in 2009, the program has turned a profit. And it has been demonstrably effective: it lent money to Tesla to build its factory in Fremont, California, when the private sector would not, for instance. Every Tesla you see on the road came from a facility financed by the D.O.E. Its loans to early-stage solar-energy companies launched the industry. There are now 35 viable utility-scale, privately funded solar companies—up from zero a decade ago. And yet today the program sits frozen. “There’s no direction what to do with the applications,” says the young career civil servant. “Are we shutting the program down?” They’d rather not, but if that’s what they are going to do, they should do it. “There’s no staff, just me,” says the civil servant. “People keep bugging me for direction. It’s got to the point I don’t care if you tell me to tear the program down. Just tell me what you want to do so I can do it intelligently.” Another permanent employee, in another wing of the D.O.E., says, “The biggest change is the grinding to a halt of any proactive work. There’s very little work happening. There’s a lot of confusion about what our mission was going to be. For a majority of the workforce it’s been demoralizing.”

Altogether, it takes seven years for the wildebeest bones to fully disintegrate, releasing nutrients like phosphorous and carbon into the river. This slow decomposition, while unpleasant to smell, is crucial for the Mara River ecosystem, sustaining microbes, insects, and fish, as well as large scavengers. In the past, river ecologists had assumed that high levels of dissolved carbon from rotting corpses are unhealthy and unnatural for rivers. But the researchers found  that protected parks actually have more dissolved carbon their rivers compared to unprotected ones, suggesting that less human influence can sometimes mean more putrid rivers.

(…) Unfortunately, there are few ecosystems that can directly compare to the Mara. That’s because humans have disrupted nearly every large herbivore migration on the planet, and continue to kill off these key animals faster than they can kill themselves. It’s practically impossible for human biologists to get an accurate sense of what ecosystems looked like before the loss of large animals, because, according to many paleoecologists, humans have been wiping out large animals since the prehistoric migrations out of Africa.

The human migration across the Bering Strait into the Americas 15,000 years ago was followed by the extinctions of American mammoths and mastodons, giant ground sloths, sabre-tooth cats and giant armadillos. Other continents also suffered losses. When humans first landed in Australia 60,000 years ago, they would have encountered 500-pound kangaroos, 10-foot-tall flightless birds, wombat relatives the size of rhinoceroses, and monitor lizards that grew to over 20 feet long. By 45,000 years ago, all of those species were gone.

“Willy Spiller’s images are as much a visual document of this incomparable realm as they are a syncopated, colorful poem to the city of New York and its people,” shares publisher Sturm & Drang. In fact, Spiller wasn't going on expeditions to specifically photograph the subway more than using it as a means of transport to arrive at his photo assignments. The shots are a simple byproduct of photographing while he was a passenger like everyone else.

You watch more. There’s a video of her interviewing a basil plant and two of her reading out loudfrom the Bible. In one, her nose spontaneously starts bleeding. All of her videos are like this: unsettling, repetitive, sparse. Imagine anime mixed with a healthy heap of David Lynch, a dash of Ariana Grande, and one stick of bubblegum. There are a few characters who appear in the videos besides Poppy—one of her recurring guests is a talking mannequin.

Most of her videos are too unnerving to watch from beginning to end for reasons that are hard to put your finger on. You find yourself scrolling to the comments in the middle of the more unsettling scenes, the digital equivalent of turning to a friend in the movie theater and gauging their reaction to the batshit thing you just saw onscreen.

Making matters worse is the astonishing “safety” record of the chemical industry. Between January and August 2016, China suffered 232 accidents in chemical factories, such as leaks, fires and explosions—almost one a day. Since around a fifth of these factories are in China’s most productive agricultural areas or near rivers used for irrigation, many of the spilled chemicals end up in fields. Chemical factories are not the only culprits. About 150km from Mr Tang’s village, in a town called Chenzhou, part of a lead and zinc mine collapsed in 1985, flooding nearby farms with arsenic, a by-product of mining. Arsenic concentrations in the soil were 24 times the legal limit 30 years later.

The second big problem is that land is being poisoned by “sewage irrigation”. Wastewater and industrial effluent are used in increasing amounts for irrigation because there is not enough fresh water to go round. In the north of China there is less water available per person than in Saudi Arabia, so farmers use whatever they can get. China produces over 60bn tonnes of sewage a year and in rural areas only 10% of it is treated. Most of the sludge goes into lakes and rivers, and thence onto fields.

A study in 2014 found that 39 out of 55 areas using sewage irrigation were contaminated by cadmium, arsenic and other poisons and that the accumulation of heavy metals in intensively irrigated areas was rising. An earlier study from 2010 found that water along 18% of the length of China’s rivers was too polluted for use in agriculture. It is used anyway.

One of the most influential art historians of the era was Johann Joachim Winckelmann. He produced two volumes recounting the history of ancient art, Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums (1764), which were widely read and came to form a foundation for the modern field of art history. These books celebrate the whiteness of classical statuary and cast the Apollo of the Belvedere — a Roman marble copy of a Hellenistic bronze original — as the quintessence of beauty. Historian Nell Irvin Painter writes in her book The History of White People (2010) that Winckelmann was a Eurocentrist who depreciated people of other nationalities, like the Chinese or the Kalmyk.

“Color in sculpture came to mean barbarism, for they assumed that the lofty ancient Greeks were too sophisticated to color their art,” Painter writes. The ties between barbarism and color, civility and whiteness would endure. Not to mention Winckelmann’s pronounced preference for sculptures of gleaming white men over women. Regardless of his own sexual identity — which may have been expressed in this preference — Winckelmann’s gender bias would go on to have an impact on white male supremacists who saw themselves as upholding an ideal.

Comment faire pour «ouvrir le corps» tout en chassant l’image répugnante du cadavre ? Dominique Brancher raconte : à l’idée négative de la dissection, l’image anatomique substitue celle, érotique, d’un dévoilement. Il s’agit de jouer sur l’attrait du mystère et de l’interdit. La gynécologie devient donc, en toute bonne logique, le premier bastion à faire sauter : ce savoir, jusqu’ici réservé aux sage-femmes, fait l’objet d’une florissante production sur le marché éditorial français du XVIe siècle. «En 1482 paraît à Lyon la première gravure sur bois représentant une dissection académique». Comme par hasard, «c’est le corps d’une femme éventrée que cernent cinq médecins aux poses hiératiques. Au cours des mêmes années lyonnaises sont publiées les premières gravures de dissections “profanes”, qui accompagnent les éditions du Roman de la Rose : Néron, devant sa mère assassinée, ordonne l’ouverture de l’utérus pour percer le mystère de son origine. 

(…) Près de soixante ans plus tard, dans un style flamboyant et plus sensuel, Vésale fera le même choix audacieux : sur le frontispice ouvrant le De humani corporis fabrica (Bâle, Oporinus, 1543), une foule agitée entoure un cadavre féminin découpé.»

Les premières images anatomiques sont donc, principalement, des images indécentes de corps féminin qu’une foule de mâles sondent, pénètrent, théorisent, commentent et s’approprient avec une sorte de délectation que le lecteur est invité à partager. «Le genre des “secrets des femmes” constitue une invention proprement européenne, souligne Dominique Brancher. Cette invention prétend distiller, sur le ton de la confidence, un savoir ésotérique et fonde son efficacité culturelle sur le jeu dialectique de l’exhibition et de la dissimulation, ce qu’on pourrait appeler le “spectacle du secret”. Paradoxalement, pour exister, le secret doit se signaler à ceux qu’il vise et montrer qu’il cache». Montrer qu’il cache : c’est le ressort même de la pornographie qui met l’orgasme féminin en scène, spectaculairement, comme une sorte d’événement dont on ne peut jamais être tout à fait sûr de l’avoir vu. L’orgasme féminin relève de l’invisible. On peut le simuler. Dès lors, en faire des films, c’est comme se condamner à tuer sa mère dans l’espoir de comprendre pourquoi elle vous a mis au monde.

Pour Jean-Laurent Cassely, cette véritable «anomalie sociologique» trouve son origine dans «l’appauvrissement des tâches des métiers à dominante intellectuelle». Se basant sur de nombreux témoignages recueillis auprès de ces «néo-artisans», le journaliste constate ainsi un décalage croissant entre les attentes de ces jeunes ex-cadres et la réalité du travail qui leur était demandé dans leurs anciens jobs. Un décalage souvent brandi comme le motif principal de leur reconversion. «Beaucoup se voyaient comme avant-garde de la mondialisation, et non comme de bons petits soldats de la suite Microsoft office», résume ainsi le journaliste.

(…) La thèse, pour séduisante qu’elle soit, a cependant ses limites. Comme le note avec humour Jean-Laurent Cassely, on aurait tort de voir dans ces «néo-artisans» de farouches alter-mondialistes résolus à renverser le dogme existant. Bien au contraire. Comme il le démontre brillamment, leurs projets de reconversion s’intègrent parfaitement à l’économie de marché. «Par leur capacité à aborder différents secteurs de l’artisanat sous l’angle abstrait de leur ancienne formation, ils reclassent des secteurs autrefois dévalorisés», nous explique-t-il. S’ils redessinent notre conception de l’organisation du travail, ces «néo-artisans» entretiennent également la logique de gentrification des centres urbains, répondant à la demande d’une clientèle dont ils maîtrisent parfaitement les codes, puisqu’ils en sont issus et qu’ils les côtoient dans les hypercentres urbains désormais réservés aux catégories aisées de la population française.

The effect of Dodge’s realm – the LA art world – on her work has been profound. “I tend to think of writing almost structurally – I’m a kind of formalist – and my ideas about how to solve problems don’t always come from other books.” It was a culture shock, moving to LA from New York, as she did many years ago now. But it was also freeing. “There’s no pedestrian culture here. You’re never going to walk into a bookstore and see what everyone is reading, and therefore you can drift. That can be bad, but it’s also good: you don’t respond to trends, you follow strange leads.”

Writing has always been something I do feverishly, along with trying to make ends meet. But I also know that if you spend too much time thinking about a simulacrum of yourself, it takes you away from the act of writing. You need to shut everything out. I think of ideas as murmuring things you have to let talk to you in a quiet room, and that requires a lot of concentration as I get older.”

Perhaps, in the end, everything will continue just as it was before. “The world is full of distractions,” she says, softly. “And I have to listen more and more closely.”

La première raison du succès politique de la notion de ville compacte, définie comme « villes des petites distances » (entre domicile, lieux d’emploi, commerces, hôpitaux, etc.), est qu’elle apparaît comme un instrument efficace pour réduire les effets négatifs de la décroissance urbaine sur la vie quotidienne des Japonais. À l’instar de ce qui est observé dans les villes en décroissance européennes (Baron et al. 2010), le déclin progresse en perforant les tissus urbains japonais : des commerces ferment, faute d’usagers, ce qui allonge les distances à parcourir pour trouver des magasins ouverts (Iwama 2011) ; une maison vacante non entretenue se détériore et nuit à la qualité de l’environnement résidentiel, etc.

Dans la recherche et les médias, l’agriculture urbaine est considérée comme une pratique universellement bénéfique, incapable de générer le moindre désagrément. Pourtant, de plus en plus de chercheur·e·s, souvent issu·e·s de la géographie radicale et critique (Guthman 2008 ; Safransky 2014 ; Tornaghi 2014), ont pris le contre-pied de cette posture, en rappelant que les bénéfices annoncés sont plus controversés qu’au premier abord et sont souvent insuffisamment étayés. Les avantages économiques réels, les services écosystémiques rendus, et les créations d’emplois liés à l’agriculture urbaine demeurent difficiles à évaluer et minimes à ce jour. Il y a peu de preuves de lien direct entre l’occupation des parcelles vacantes par l’agriculture urbaine et la baisse du taux de criminalité (Raleigh et Galster 2014).

En réalité, les bénéfices sont envisagés pour des habitants qui ont des niveaux d’engagement très hétérogènes, notamment en termes d’acceptation et d’intérêt pour l’agriculture urbaine. Les habitants de Détroit consultés dans le cadre du processus de légalisation ont exprimé un scepticisme généralisé (Paddeu 2017). Ils considèrent l’agriculture urbaine comme une source d’incertitudes et de nuisances (pesticides, cultures OGM, élevage…). Ainsi, plutôt que de constituer un facteur attractif à même de revivifier les quartiers vidés de leurs habitants, elle pourrait en fait constituer un facteur répulsif et contribuer à leur départ. Une étude menée dans un quartier de Détroit montre que les résidents ont une foi limitée dans le pouvoir de l’agriculture urbaine d’améliorer leur vie quotidienne ainsi que de changer la dynamique sociale du quartier (Draus et al., 2014). De fait, l’écart reste substantiel entre les aspirations idéalistes des habitants-militants, constituant un réseau très actif mais restreint, et l’implication de la majorité des résidents.

Je commençais à connaître l’exacte valeur du langage parlé ou muet de l’amabilité aristocratique, amabilité heureuse de verser un baume sur le sentiment d’infériorité de ceux à l’égard desquels elle s’exerce mais pas pourtant jusqu’au point de la dissiper, car dans ce cas elle n’aurait plus de raison d’être. “Mais vous êtes notre égal, sinon mieux”, semblaient, par toutes leurs actions, dire les Guermantes ; et ils le disaient de la façon la plus gentille que l’on puisse imaginer, pour être aimés, admirés, mais non pour être crus ; qu’on démêlât le caractère fictif de cette amabilité, c’est ce qu’ils appelaient être bien élevés ; croire l’amabilité réelle, c’était la mauvaise éducation.

The desire to censor the pregnant female body is nothing new, and it goes hand in hand with our inability to discuss things like the menstrual cycle without deferring to the delicate sensibilities of actual or imagined listeners, particularly male ones. Beyoncé’s photographs were accompanied by a poem by Warsan Shire, making the link to Venus— goddess of love— explicit, and reinforcing the sexual aspect of the images: ‘in the dream I am crowning / osun, / Nerfetiti, / and yemoja / pray around my bed’. The photograph that seemed to incense people the most was the one posed sitting on the roof of a car: a hyper-sexualised pose familiar to many from calendars and glamour magazines.

Critics were also vocal about the ‘exploitative’ nature of the photographs, suggesting that there was something unseemly about Beyoncé— who, as of March 2017, has a net worth estimated by Forbes to be over $290 million — ‘using’ her pregnancy to contribute to her lucrative personal brand. The announcement illustrated a familiar truth: the intersection of female sexuality and economic power— and its mirror image, commodification— touches on deep-seated societal fears. Although the smattering of tight-lipped comment pieces framing their disapproval of the photograph’s lavish celebration of the pregnant body as concern for childless women were mostly disingenuous— this concern doesn’t usually seem to bother tabloid newspapers who mine ‘fertility’ dramas for exposure— they served to illuminate the paradox of maternity: censorship goes hand in hand with idealisation. Some of the positive responses to the announcement were deceptively conservative in their valourisation of motherhood as a woman’s ‘true’ purpose, something all too easily appropriated by exclusionary and harmful discussions about what ‘real’ womanhood is or should be.

« Sous Khrouchtchev, la stratégie reposait sur la création de microquartiers au centre desquels se trouvaient une école, une polyclinique, où les voitures ne circulaient pas. La distance entre chaque immeuble et l’école ne devait pas dépasser 400 mètres », poursuit Evgueni Asse en traçant des croquis sur sa longue table de travail. Pour la première fois, surtout, les ­Soviétiques accèdent au logement individuel. En 1950, plus de la moitié des cinq millions d’habitants dans la capitale russe vivaient encore dans des kommunalka, des appartements communautaires, ou dans des baraques en bois, construites après-guerre à titre temporaire. En principe.

« L’accès aux khrouchtchevki, c’était l’accession non à la propriété privée, mais aux appartements séparés, à la possibilité de s’installer en famille, souligne la Française Hélène Richard, auteure d’une thèse sur le logement et la propriété en Russie. Les immeubles étaient gérés par des entreprises d’Etat ou des municipalités qui établissaient des baux et se chargeaient de l’entretien et des documents. Les charges étaient très faibles. » Transmis aux enfants, ces baux soviétiques, plutôt protecteurs, ont concerné des générations entières de résidents. Près de 127 millions de Soviétiques, à travers toute l’URSS, y ont vécu, selon le journaliste indépendant Iouri Bolotov.

De façon tout aussi arbitraire, ils en dressent des typologies distinguant le normal du pathologique. Certains hymens sont jugés conformes, d’autres pas. L’absence d’hymen, par exemple, relève de la difformité. En vertu de quels critères ? «Lorsque le discours scientifique s’en saisit – et en particulier au XIXe siècle, où les théories médicales se basent sur la multiplication des observations et des statistiques –, le fréquent devient le normal», note Pauline Mortas qui dénonce la confusion entre la moyenne et la normalité d’une part, le rare et l’anomalie d’autre part. Gare aux femmes qui sortent du lot. Les voilà estampillées handicapées, même si la forme de leur hymen ne présente en soi aucun risque pour la santé et ne gêne ni les rapports sexuels, ni la grossesse. De façon très révélatrice, parmi les hymens classés «anormaux» certains savants classent ceux qui peuvent laisser croire à des déchirures ou des viols : ce sont les hymens dits frangés ou infundibuliformes, dont l’aspect par trop douteux ne correspond pas à l’hymen idéal des médecins : celui qui indique clairement si une femme est vierge. Car c’est bien de cela qu’il est question lorsque les savants inventent l’hymen : ils inventent l’idée selon laquelle un bout de chair servirait de «preuve» tangible de la virginité.

He spots the power plant’s offshore cooling water intakes and outflows that are creating abstract, expressionist patterns in the mudflats and sea. “That tells me they are dumping hot water into the bay which is going to affect the marine life. What about its waste coal ash? Where does all that go?” he asks.

Back on the ground, Fair says his environmental images must be both meaningful and beautiful to work. “Art that is beautiful but not meaningful is decoration. Art that is meaningful without beauty is pedantic. I want to make art that tells a story to regular people; art which hopefully gives them an insight into our world.

“What we buy doesn’t come with information about the hidden costs: the air that is fouled, the water contaminated, the habitat destroyed, or the workers exploited. But these are real costs that must inevitably be paid, a burden that ultimately falls on all of us.”

Consider a student who always starts her homework the moment it’s assigned.  What might look like an admirable display of self-discipline, given that there are other things she’d rather be doing, may actually be due to an acute discomfort with having anything unfinished.  She wants – or, more accurately, needs – to get the assignment out of the way in order to stave off anxiety.  (The fact that something resembling self-discipline is required to complete a task doesn’t bode well for the likelihood of deriving any intellectual benefit from it.  Learning, after all, depends not on what students do so much as on how they regard and construe what they do.  To assume otherwise is to revert to a crude behaviorism long since repudiated by serious scholars.)

More generally, self-discipline can be less a sign of health than of vulnerability.  It may reflect a fear of being overwhelmed by external forces, or by one’s own desires, that must be suppressed through continual effort.  In effect, such individuals suffer from a fear of being out of control.  In his classic work Neurotic Styles, David Shapiro described how someone might function as “his own overseer, issuing commands, directives, reminders, warnings, and admonitions concerning not only what is to be done and what is not to be done, but also what is to be wanted, felt, and even thought.”  Secure, healthy people can be playful, flexible, open to new experiences and self-discovery, deriving satisfaction from the process rather than always focused on the product.  An extremely self-disciplined student, by contrast, may see reading or problem-solving purely as a means to the end of a good test score or a high grade.  In Shapiro’s more general formulation, such people “do not feel comfortable with any activity that lacks an aim or a purpose beyond its own pleasure, and usually they do not recognize the possibility of finding life satisfying without a continuous sense of purpose and effort.”

In dem Dorf in der deindustrialisierten Picardie, über das ich meinen ersten Roman Das Ende von Eddy geschrieben habe, herrschten Arbeitslosigkeit, Elend, Alkohol, Gewalt, eine brutale Männlichkeit. In diesem Milieu, aus dem auch Bourdieu stammt, ist Politik eine Frage von Leben und Tod. Man spürt sie am lebendigen Leibe: in der medizinischen Versorgung, beim Essen, im sexuellen Alltag. Die politischen Fragen heißen: Gehe ich zum Arzt, wenn ich krank bin? Gibt es heute Abend etwas zu essen? Kann ich sexueller Gewalt entkommen? Mein Vater ist zum ersten Mal in seinem Leben zum Zahnarzt gegangen, als ich 14 Jahre alt war, weil der Staat eine Beihilfe geschaffen hatte. Es gab Tage in meiner Kindheit, da hat meine Mutter gesagt: “Heute gibt es zum Essen nur Milch.” Ich gehe wählen, damit die körperliche Not und Gewalt aufhört. Das Wahlrecht ist für mich dabei ein politisches Instrument unter vielen.

Une langue unique, cela n’existe pas, à moins de robotiser les humains ! On a toujours créé de la diversité. Et puis, cette idée qu’une société ne peut fonctionner que si on s’exprime tous exactement de la même façon est fausse. A l’école, on parle de l’importance de la «maîtrise de la langue». Ce mot «maîtrise» est chargé de sens. Comme s’il était question de la dompter, de la domestiquer à la manière d’un animal sauvage. Nous avons un rapport très particulier à la langue, de l’ordre du totem, d’un symbole absolu de l’identité nationale. C’est presque une religion. Je pèse mes mots. 

Un exemple. Lors du débat parlementaire sur la déchéance de la nationalité, il y a quelques semaines, une députée a tweeté : «Respecter la France, c’est d’abord respecter sa langue…» L’attachement à la langue est de l’ordre du sacré, ancré dans la tête des gens dès l’école. Ce qui explique d’ailleurs que la plupart l’acceptent, jouent le jeu, renoncent à leur langue régionale ou immigrée, à leur accent régional ou social, changent leur manière de parler, les mots qu’ils emploient en se disant ne pas avoir le choix. L’idéologie est tellement prégnante qu’on transpose cette pression sur les langues étrangères. On va par exemple collectivement considérer que bien parler l’anglais, c’est s’exprimer avec l’accent de la bourgeoisie londonienne. Comme si c’était le seul accent valable ! Alors que vous pouvez parler l’anglais à votre façon, les anglophones ne donneront pas d’importance à votre accent.

One of the sneakier pitfalls of an efficiency-based attitude to time is that we start to feel pressured to use our leisure time “productively”, too – an attitude which implies that enjoying leisure for its own sake, which you might have assumed was the whole point of leisure, is somehow not quite enough. And so we find ourselves, for example, travelling to unfamiliar places not for the sheer experience of travel, but in order to add to our mental storehouse of experiences, or to our Instagram feeds. We go walking or running to improve our health, not for the pleasure of movement; we approach the tasks of parenthood with a fixation on the successful future adults we hope to create.

In his 1962 book The Decline of Pleasure, the critic Walter Kerr noticed this shift in our experience of time: “We are all of us compelled to read for profit, party for contracts, lunch for contacts … and stay home for the weekend to rebuild the house.” Even rest and recreation, in a culture preoccupied with efficiency, can only be understood as valuable insofar as they are useful for some other purpose – usually, recuperation, so as to enable more work. (Several conference guests mentioned Arianna Huffington’s current crusade to encourage people to get more sleep; for her, it seems, the main point of rest is to excel at the office.)

The standard view is that the switch to an energy system based on renewables will take at least half a century.

This opinion is largely derived from Professor Vaclav Smil's work on previous transitions from one fuel to another. We have all gone on to assume that the future will be like the past.

In contrast, I argue that the growth of solar PV, in particular, will not be restrained by the forces that held back new fuels in the past. Of course, nobody actually knows how rapid the growth of renewables will be but my purpose in this note is to suggest that Smil's view may be incomplete and that solar and wind will continue to grow at far faster rates than he suggests are possible.

One thing is that mother trees suckle their children, they feed the young tree just enough sugars produced by its own photosynthesis to keep it from dying. Trees in a forest of the same species are connected by the roots, which grow together like a network. Their root tips have highly sensitive brain-like structures that can distinguish whether the root that it encounters in the soil is its own root, the root of another species, or the roots of its own species. If it encounters its own kind, I don’t know if scientists yet know how this happens, but we have measured with radioactive-marked sugar molecules that there is a flow from healthy trees to sick trees so that they will have an equal measure of food and energy available.

(…) We have this essentially arbitrary caste system for living beings. We say plants are the lowest caste, the pariahs because they don’t have brains, they don’t move, they don’t have big brown eyes. Flies and insects have eyes, so they are a bit higher, but not so high as monkeys and apes and so on. I want to remove trees from this caste system. This hierarchical ranking of living beings is totally unscientific. Plants process information just as animals do, but for the most part they do this much more slowly. Is life in the slow lane worth less than life on the fast track?

A common myth, promoted by the rich, is that wealth is produced individually before it is collectivized by the state, through taxation. In fact, wealth was always produced collectively and privatized by those with the power to do it: the propertied class. Farmland and seeds, pre-modern forms of capital, were collectively developed through generations of peasant endeavor that landlords appropriated by stealth. Today, every smartphone comprises components developed by some government grant, or through the commons of pooled ideas, for which no dividends have ever been paid to society.

so how should society be compensated? Taxation is the wrong answer. Corporations pay taxes in exchange for services the state provides them, not for capital injections that must yield dividends. There is thus a strong case that the commons have a right to a share of the capital stock, and associated dividends, reflecting society’s investment in corporations’ capital. And, because it is impossible to calculate the size of state and social capital crystalized in any firm, we can decide how much of its capital stock the public should own only by means of a political mechanism.

They say plastic lingers in the natural environment for years, and they’re not kidding. Here was a packet of crisps from my childhood, indeed one I might have saved up tokens for myself before sticking them (along with a 65p postal order) into an envelope. The world has spun thousands of times since 1974, and yet here was a wrapper still mostly intact, its special offer still legible, washed up on the shore as if only recently thrown away.

The numbers can be confusing but the thrust was clear. The big idea, in design terms, was to return to a more traditional streetscape and more suburban style of architecture. The stated aim of the Peckham Partnership was to ‘provide family houses and a neighbourhood environment which encourages study, work, leisure and healthy living’. The architect Will Alsop praised the new build’s ‘more traditional type of architecture with pitched roofs’ and a circulation around its buildings which felt ‘much safer and…more embracing’.

To Pollard Thomas & Edwards, the previous renovations, which involved the removal of walkways and partial demolitions but had left the basic layout of North Peckham intact, had been inadequate: the ‘homes themselves were fine, it was the bits in between that were disastrous’. The new scheme, they claimed, would create a legible street pattern and a link between the shops and amenities of Peckham High Street and Burgess Park.

This was ‘back to the future’ with a vengeance, echoing all the tropes of the contemporary ‘defensible space’ movement which emphasised the ‘natural surveillance’ of the streets and the need to increase private space and reduce twilight zones of semi-public space.

WH: Tell me about Pokémon Go. What is happening on Pokémon Go?

This 11-mile stretch is one of the only places that defied the Army Corps’ Depression-era efforts at control. The bottom of the river was so soft that the concrete would not stick. As a result, this section of river is a purling, cobble- and rock-studded waterway with swimming mallards, blue herons, and cormorants atop boulders drying their outstretched wings. Both banks, though, form a massive concrete trough.

Still, nature finds a way. It turns out that water sheeting over the concrete grows algae that are an important foraging habitat for shorebirds. Indeed, on the day I visited, a black-necked stilt was working these hard bottom shallows.

(…) Historical ecology — the study of old photos, maps, and diary accounts — will provide a sense of what the river once looked like, including the wildlife and plant species present. This will help guide restoration. “It gives you a sense of options for the future,” Parker says.

Blogging’s a lot of effort for scant reward, so if hardly anybody’s reading what you write, why bother? Alternative platforms have taken hold, and take far less effort to update, and get instant feedback. Self-broadcasting is no clique any more, it’s a universal collective, which leaves those of us who still create long-form prose down something of a cul-de-sac. Indeed images have already overtaken text for most, as people spend their days looking at photos of their mates, watching videos of comical kittens, capturing their food on Instagram, making conversation by appending snapshots from TV shows, and responding via emoji. Why bother writing anything, quite frankly, when nobody has time for anything more than swiftly digestible visual nuggets?

(…) Most importantly, new readers no longer come clicking via a long-standing blogroll in a sidebar. Instead they arrive via a one-off reference on social media, if they turn up at all, because Twitter and Facebook are very much in charge these days. A blog is now only as good as its last post, and long-term reputation counts for almost nothing. I’m very much aware that my daily readership is now almost exclusively people who arrived here once and stayed, and all too rarely fresh blood directed in from elsewhere.

The service of Loophole for All acquires the lists of companies incorporated in the offshore centers and armed with as little as a company name and a number, lets people hijack those companies and utilize them for public advantage.

This corporate identity theft benefits from the anonymous nature of those offshore companies. Everyone can pretend to be them because of their real owners’ secrecy. And even if it’s illegal to steal an identity of a company, the courts of offshoring centers don’t have any power or credibility onshore. And meanwhile, onshore authorities don’t have the resources to verify the real owners of companies offshore — even less to chase everybody down.

Society is built on interfaces. You take a complex thing, put it inside a sturdy box, and put some simple buttons on the box so that people can use the thing inside. The box makes it easier to use and prevents people from breaking it. For example, you can take the machinery of a clock, put it in a box, and put two hands on the outside along with a knob for winding it. Take all the machinery of a car, hide it behind a dashboard, and give people two pedals and wheel. Take all the circuits of a computer, put them in a box, and give people a monitor and a keyboard.

Interfaces receive input and produce output, and that’s all we need to know. The clock gets wound, and its hands show the time. Input and output. As far as the user needs to know, what happens inside the box is magic. This allows stupid and ignorant people to use complicated things, as long as the interface inputs and outputs are simple.

Toyota uses millions of kilograms of steel every year. Does the CEO of Toyota know how to make steel from scratch? If he wanted to beat a guy up, could he go digging in the ground for some ore and whip himself up a batch of steel to make a pipe? No. He uses interfaces to get steel. He buys steel from an steelmaking company. Except he doesn’t personally go down to the steelmaking company with a bag full of Yen, saying, “How much for a million kilos?” He uses a bank. Except he doesn’t even personally go to the bank. He has a subordinate who does it for him. All these people and institutions are interfaces he can use. He employs a system of layered interfaces, both metaphorical and literal, to control things he doesn’t really understand. We all do. The point is this: don’t go messing with the CEO of Toyota. I assure you, he could get his hands on a steel pipe if he wanted.

Once thought to be the most densely populated place on Earth, with 50,000 people crammed into only a few blocks, these fascinating pictures give a rare insight into the lives of those who lived Kowloon Walled City.

Taken by Canadian photographer Greg Girard in collaboration with Ian Lamboth the pair spent five years familiarising themselves with the notorious Chinese city before it was demolished in 1992.

The city was a phenomenon with 33,000 families and businesses living in more than 300 interconnected high-rise buildings, all constructed without contributions from a single architect.

For another thing, “Game of Thrones” had dragons, and I place a total embargo on dragons. I would almost rather have zombies. Bolstered by these and other relevant prejudices, I managed to ward off “Game of Thrones” for months. Then a box of the first season somehow got into the house. It lay there unopened on the parlor table while I thought of further objections. For yet another thing, “Game of Thrones” had Sean Bean as a hero, when everybody knows that Sean Bean is meant to be a heavy, one who flexes his teeth and grits his jaw before being eliminated by Christian Bale in “Equilibrium” or Harrison Ford in “Patriot Games.”

How do we know when a photographer caters to life and not to some previous prejudice? One clue is when the picture evades compositional cliché. But there is also the question of what the photograph is for, what role it plays within the economic circulation of images. Some photographs, like Singh’s, are freer of the censorship of the market. Others are taken only to elicit particular conventional responses — images that masquerade as art but fully inhabit the vocabulary of advertising. As Justice Potter Stewart said when pressed to define hard-core pornography in 1964, “I know it when I see it.”

For black Gen-Xers like myself, who witnessed past scenes of black torture caught on camera, like the beating of motorist Rodney King by LAPD officers back in 1991, this is a moment in which the truth of black death and incarceration feels both familiar and utterly new. We are more than accustomed to managing our fury and incredulity about the insult of racial violence and its casual, chronic erasure from the public conversation. What is harder to process is seeing the faces and hearing the stories of the dead in great detail from surviving family members grappling with unspeakable pain. We who watch these daily tragedies unfold on our phones and laptops and cable news watch from afar but feel the sad heaviness of what it means to experience one’s blackness as precarious and unprotected, as eviscerated of its citizenship. To live like that is to walk through the world always slightly numb and sceptical of what lies ahead.

As a child, Mabey hadn’t studied botany, having little feeling for plants in a conventional scientific sense. “But the idea of an entanglement between human culture and the natural world like that struck some chord in me. I thought it was a terrific story and I was quite sure there would be more examples round Britain. So I invented this book.

(…) “I believe in microcosmic views,” he says. “They seem to me not just powerful metaphors, but actually the nano-bricks for rebuilding things. This is where it starts. There is such a multitude of things going on round here at a local level. I’m kept an optimist by that.”

What becomes absolutely critical I think in rethinking Malthus is what he says about this. This process of removing people off land in order to make space for British Europeans is something that troubled him deeply. So he says at various points in a couple of chapters, especially the chapters where he’s talking about North America but not only, that the original inhabitants should not be driven into a corner he says, where they will starve. That this is an exercise, that this is an outcome that cannot be considered for an instant. So Malthus in 1803 was deeply troubled by the process by which land would and people, would be cleared in order to make space for the cultivation of grain. And this is something that he thinks about most directly with respect to North America. Not something that he yet thinks about with respect to the colony of New South Wales because it was not yet in 1803 really, there was no pastoral expansion as yet. It’s quite interesting that Malthus doesn’t imagine the continent of Australia as yet available for pastoral expansion. He understands it for what it was at that point, which was a very local coastal settlement.

So this whole question of what happens to original occupants of various New World lands is something that he’s concerned about with respect to the American instance in particular. And it’s that he has, not that many but three or four times in the early, in these early chapters of the Essay, he’s quite clear that driving natives into a corner which is the way he puts it, is an extremely problematic undertaking and something that he says we should not consider for an instant. And that Malthus has often over the years been understood, often in a very knee jerk way as essentially a conservative, this is not what we expect, the received Malthus to have said.

The rise of the New Brutalism was an expression of this discrepancy in sensibilities, and the new appetite for coarse textures and raw materials—as opposed to the sleek machine finishes sought during the 1920s—was a tentative first step toward bringing architecture into harmony with the other arts. The critic Reyner Banham made this point in an important 1955 article in the Architectural Review published in December 1955: “In the last resort what characterizes the New Brutalism in architecture as in painting is precisely its brutality, its je-m’en-foutisme, its bloody-mindedness.” 

(…) For more than a generation now, architecture has aspired to a state of absolute sleekness, in which materials have no weight and surfaces no texture. The practice of designing by computer—not only preparing drawings but conceiving them on the computer screen, and gauging their visual qualities there—has accelerated the process to the point where most buildings give the impression of having been put together through a cold, analytical process, without any feeling for the physicality of materials.

In those days the mark of the beast was clearly imprinted on the ravished terrain between the A13 and the river: discontinued industries, generic towers rising on the malign compost of the deregulated financial markets, crude surveillance systems protecting speculative retail parks. ‘Don’t you know there’s a war on?’ The repeated challenge as security guards questioned me at every imposed barrier. Thatcher was an abiding presence. Like the smell of the Thames: oil and river-rot and yellow mud. Along walls and embankments, the rabid slogans and anti-Thatcher curses were large and scarlet. In certain hideaway pubs, inscribed photographs in polished frames signalled a positive allegiance. Now, from the window of the empty train to Tilbury, there was nothing. No acknowledgment of funeral or legacy. Margaret Thatcher’s traces were visible in every new shed, in every mushroom estate under a pergola of pylons, but she was forgotten.

They schedule in time with friends the way students with 4.0 G.P.A.’s  make sure to sign up for community service because it looks good on their college applications. I recently wrote a friend to ask if he wanted to do something this week, and he answered that he didn’t have a lot of time but if something was going on to let him know and maybe he could ditch work for a few hours. I wanted to clarify that my question had not been a preliminary heads-up to some future invitation; this was the invitation.

Identified as a submerged microcontinent by a team of scientists in 1999, the Kerguelen Plateau was built up by eruptions from the hotspot over the next 20 million years before emerging above sea level. A rather quick event in geologic time, the sudden eruption of the plateau may have contributed to a global catastrophe at that time in the form of a global oceanic anoxic event, in which the earth’s oceans are deprived of oxygen and marine life dies off en masse; interestingly, much of the world’s petroleum resources credit their origins to the massive marine extinctions of this time period.
    
The plateau existed above water as a microcontinent three different times over a period of 80 million years before it went underwater for a final time about 20 million years ago; a combination of a change in characteristics in the mantle plume which fed Kerguelen’s construction, sea level change, and the inevitable process of erosion (the same reason the northwesternmost Hawaiian Islands are so much smaller than the southeasternmost islands; they’re older). Floor samples indicate that the microcontinent was covered by a coniferous forest.

A recent infographic in The Economist revealed that in the 140 million hours humanity spent watching “Gangnam Style” on YouTube two billion times, we could have built at least four more (desperately needed) pyramids at Giza. Endless articles pose the question of why we procrastinate, what’s going wrong in the brain, how to overcome it, and the fascinating irrationality of it all.

But if procrastination is so clearly a society-wide, public condition, why is it always framed as an individual, personal deficiency? Why do we assume our own temperaments and habits are at fault — and feel bad about them — rather than question our culture’s canonization of productivity?

(…) While passive-aggressive personality disorder has been erased from the official portion of the manual, the stigma of slothfulness remains. Many of us, it seems, are still trying to enforce a military-style precision on our intellectual, creative, civilian lives — and often failing.

(…) Oblomov could conduct the few tasks he cared to from under his quilt — writing letters, accepting visitors — but what if he’d had an iPhone and a laptop? Being in bed is now no excuse for dawdling, and no escape from the guilt that accompanies it. The voice — societal or psychological — urging us away from sloth to the pure, virtuous heights of productivity has become a sort of birdlike shriek as more individuals work from home and set their own schedules, and as the devices we use for work become alluring sirens to our own distraction. We are now able to accomplish tasks at nearly every moment, even if we prefer not to.

Certes, la proximité géographique est très souvent une variable importante. Mais pourquoi devrait-elle être la seule ? Instister sur la co-présence dévalorise toutes les autres formes de proximité. Etre proche géographiquement de quelqu’un (partager une même pièce) ne signifie pas pour autant qu’on prenne activement soin de lui, qu’on l’écoute, qu’on l’apprécie ou qu’on partage des choses avec lui.

Affirmer que la proximité géographique est la seule façon qu’ont les humains pour être proches est une manière d’affirmer une suprématie morale des rapports traditionnels, physiques. Cela induit que le statu quo est la seule solution aux problèmes qu’engendre parfois le numérique.

There are addendums sometimes, add-ons like “I’m happy to see POC characters if the plot calls for it” or “why put in a black dude in the cast just because?” Understand what is being said there: the story that is universal is white. The default is always white. The POC character only makes it in there “when the role calls for it”. Let that sink in for a moment. Our presence in popular culture (and in non-stereotypical roles) must always be justified, but whiteness exists as the basic template. Our place at the table has to be earned.

The longer I stay here the easier it is to understand why North Americans of my generation, raised on positive reinforcement and dreams of creative fulfillment, are especially drawn to Berlin. This place allows you to escape the harsh realities of adulthood, to avoid confronting the limits of your specialness. In New York, most people I knew were working 12-hour days at bad jobs not only because they needed to make rent, but because they wanted to fit in. Here, you’re free to describe yourself as a “performance artist” or a “graphic designer,” even if you spend your entire day surfing the Internet, because, for the most part, you’re not expected to do anything at all. This aspect of the Berlin lifestyle is sometimes referred to in magazines trend pieces as “downshifting.” A less charitable German would call it “sozialverträgliche Faulheit.”

(…) Not long ago, the graffiti next to my front door began to change. The “fuck off” in “Tourists fuck off” was crossed out, and replaced with “Tourists welcome and bring your parents.” Then the whole thing was covered with a scribble of blue paint, except the word “Tourist.”

Thank goodness, I think, every time I walk past it. My neighbors, it turns out, are just as conflicted as I am.

One of the Humboldt squid’s more “attention-grabbing behaviors” is rapidly flashing nearly its entire body from red to white to red again, says Hannah Rosen, a doctoral student at Stanford’s Hopkins Marine Station in Pacific Grove, California. Actual light, like bioluminescence, isn’t involved.

The animals can speed up or slow down their flashes to send different messages. But researchers have no idea what the squid are trying to say—maybe they’re broadcasting come-ons to prospective mates, or throwing down with potential rivals. “That is the question of the hour,” says Rosen, the lead study author.

Aujourd’hui, même les foules sont formées d’un agglomérat de gens seuls qui, par aberration, se gênent physiquement – regardez par exemple, dans les embouteillages, les conducteurs enfermés qui s’insultent les uns les autres…

La deuxième, c’est l’irruption de Vendredi. Robinson est anglais, rouquin, blanc de peau, chrétien, et il voit débouler dans son univers un nègre, nu, animiste, peut-être même anthropophage sur les bords… Il est brutalement confronté à l’Autre, à la différence ; il est partagé sur la conduite à tenir, l’utiliser et le rejeter, l’assimiler et le mépriser… Comment mieux énoncer le problème du tiers-monde, des immigrés, des sans-papiers qui viennent sans cesse frapper à la porte des pays riches ?

La dernière chose que Defoe ne pouvait pas prévoir, c’est la séduction qu’exercent sur l’homme d’aujourd’hui l’île déserte, la plage de sable blond, le retour aux sources, tout ce côté Club Med et rêve stéréotypé propre aux pays qui discutent de réduction du temps de travail et d’aménagement des loisirs.
    
(…) Comme je suis un écrivain sans imagination, je n’aborde un sujet qu’après une longue enquête, après avoir amassé une foule de documentation. J’ai écrit tous mes livres de cette manière. Si j’ai un conseil à donner à un jeune romancier, c’est de ne jamais se raconter, de ne jamais se mettre sur le papier. Ma devise : trouver un bon sujet, et se documenter. Pour écrire Les Météores, j’ai visité une usine d’incinération d’ordures ménagères et fait le tour du monde, comme mes héros, d’Helsinki au Japon, de l’île Saint-Louis à Berlin.

Another layer for me that I got really interested in is that we always have this thing about making the other dangerous. So I started reading these books. I read this book on sea monsters. The 16th and 17th century maps, they didn’t understand the ocean, so it was a deep, dark, mysterious place. In these books of these sea monsters, they were half dolphins and half walruses. They had names for them. They had categories. I just became so fascinated by this. I just thought: this is so cool. What they didn’t understand, they made terrifying. Although they needed these routes to exploit, they also started putting in, like, ‘Well, be careful of these waters because they’re full of sea monsters.’ But a lot of it was actually just a marketing strategy by the mapmakers to discourage other explorers from taking those routes.

Against that monomaniacal bully, the singular origin of the text, Barthes liked to champion the reader, a delightfully many-headed, depersonalised vessel in which references and texts and ideas could chase each other around and never have to settle. And who is this free and easy reader, so full of contradictions, following possible meanings where they lead “like a run in the stocking”? You suspect it might be Barthes himself, and that as time went on, he started to suspect so, too. After all, authors, if they’re any good, are readers first: that’s why Barthes loved collecting fragments, aphorisms and citations, and making lists of books he’d never need to actually write. The reader-writer doesn’t have to be God, or daddy, or to stay under the thumb of either.

It’s interesting because her books do seem very readable in Italian. There are occasional weird idiomatic expressions that are Neapolitan words. She talks so much about people’s use of language. She tells us when someone’s speaking in dialect. She talks about how when Lila wants to, she can speak in a beautiful, educated type of Italian. We don’t really get examples of this, but Ferrante says, “She spoke like this,” or every once in awhile Elena will also fall into dialect. There’s this moment where she no longer wants to speak in dialect, it feels strange to her, but then sometimes she can go back into it. The obvious reason Ferrante doesn’t use dialect is because many Italians wouldn’t understand it. But a second reason may be that, as an Italian professor at CUNY was saying, Neapolitan dialect is very much a spoken language, and if she were writing it, there would be no point, in a way. It would lose the character that it has as a spoken language.

Lewis was 27 at the time. He looked around at colleagues at the bank who were 37, the men who might 10 years ago have said the same thing. He saw nothing left in them that suggested they could leave. They had been so transformed by the rates of pay and the needs it had created in them, they couldn’t escape from it.

In writing, habit seems to be a much stronger force than either willpower or inspiration. Consequently there must be some little quality of fierceness until the habit pattern of a certain number of words is established. There is no possibility, in me at least, of saying, “I’ll do it if I feel like it.” One never feels like awaking day after day. In fact, given the smallest excuse, one will not work at all. The rest is nonsense. Perhaps there are people who can work that way, but I cannot. I must get my words down every day whether they are any good or not.

A few years ago, after CBT had started to dominate taxpayer-funded therapy in Britain, a woman I’ll call Rachel, from Oxfordshire, sought therapy on the NHS for depression, following the birth of her first child. She was sent first to sit through a group PowerPoint presentation, promising five steps to “improve your mood”; then she received CBT from a therapist and, in between sessions, via computer.

“I don’t think anything has ever made me feel as lonely and isolated as having a computer program ask me how I felt on a scale of one to five, and – after I’d clicked the sad emoticon on the screen – telling me it was ‘sorry to hear that’ in a prerecorded voice,” Rachel recalled. Completing CBT worksheets under a human therapist’s guidance wasn’t much better.

“With postnatal depression,” she said, “you’ve gone from a situation in which you’ve been working, earning your own money, doing interesting things – and suddenly you’re at home on your own, mostly covered in sick, with no adult to talk to.” What she needed, she sees now, was real connection: that fundamental if hard-to-express sense of being held in the mind of another person, even if only for a short period each week.

Contrairement à la social-démocratie ou à son adversaire marxiste léniniste, la gauche benjaminienne ne croit pas qu’on échappe à la « cage d’acier » (stählernes Gehäuse) du capitalisme, comme la nommait Max Weber, en dévalant la pente de la fatalité historique. Non. La gauche benjaminienne parie sur le seul geste de « saisir le frein d’urgence ».

Saisir le frein d’urgence ? Classiquement le parti du Mouvement, dans ses variantes rivales et ses scissions mimétiques, veut prendre l’ennemi bourgeois de vitesse ; le stratège benjaminien prescrit, lui, de ralentir, de baisser la cadence, de couper les moteurs. Il supplie, avec Obaldia, qu’on le laisse descendre du « grand 8″… Comment s’explique cette bizarrerie programmatique ?

Over time, certain cries became widely adopted, and it is in written accounts and songbooks that we find the earliest records. Print collections of pictures of criers also became known as “Cries”, and although the oldest set in London dates from around 1600, there are those from Paris which predate these by a century. Characteristically, the Cries represented peripatetic street traders or pedlars, yet other street characters were also included from the start. At first, the Cries were supplemented by the bellman and the town crier, but then preachers, beggars, musicians and performers were added as the notion of the Cries of London became expanded by artists and print sellers seeking greater novelty through elaborating upon the original premise.

Ce discours qu’on appelle depuis Aristote économie n’intègre pas sans difficultés la question de la monnaie. Plus exactement, là où il est question de monnaie, il s’agit le plus souvent d’une économie dégénérée, d’une catégorie dangeureuse de l’échange, de sa perversion, d’un type de mouvement, rectiligne et démesuré, contraire à la perfection du mouvement circulaire, limité et parfaitement accompli.

Dans les sociétés industrielles, le pouvoir portait essentiellement sur le contrôle des biens, des capitaux, des matériaux, des machines. Bref, sur le contrôle du monde de l’objectivité. Avec l’émergence des technologies de l’information et de la communication, il se passe quelque chose d’inouï : ce sont des technologies de construction et de transformation de la subjectivité qui permettent d’agir sur l’acteur humain lui-même. L’enjeu du pouvoir devient ainsi de contrôler, de transformer, de fabriquer les esprits. L’idée n’est pas neuve, évidemment. Nous avons connu, au XXe siècle, l’expérience du totalitarisme dont l’objectif était également le contrôle des esprits par la parole, l’image, la mise en scène ou le culte de la personnalité. Et par la répression de toute opposition. Je n’affirme évidemment pas que nous vivons tous aujourd’hui dans des sociétés totalitaires. Mais j’avance l’idée que le pouvoir devient total. […] L’après-guerre a été dominée par la mise à mort du « sujet », d’un côté par les structuralistes, de l’autre par les marxistes. Je veux le réhabiliter. Et brandir comme un drapeau la « subjectivation » qui est, pour chacun, la prise en charge du sujet en lui, le mouvement par lequel un individu se transforme en acteur social capable de promouvoir et de défendre les droits humains fondamentaux, universels, quand ceux-ci sont bafoués.

Uploading website content as a strangely old-fashioned form of labour – literally manual, with repetitive hand movements you might expect in a production line. (Ctl-c, Ctl-v, click. Ctl-c, Ctl-v, click). These clicks and taps amplifying content and transforming it into something seamless and inevitable. It’s nice to think of all these websites as handcrafted.

The problem that Sapphire and Steel have come to solve is, as ever, to do with time. At the service station, there is temporal bleed-through from earlier periods: images and figures from 1925 and 1948 keep appearing, so that, as Sapphire and Steel’s colleague Silver puts it ‘time just got mixed, jumbled up, together, making no sort of sense’. Anachronism, the slippage of discrete time periods into one another, was throughout the series the major symptom of time breaking down.

(…) In this final assignment, the anachronism has led to stasis: time has stopped. The service station is in ‘a pocket, a vacuum’. There’s ‘still traffic, but it’s not going anywhere’: the sound of cars is locked into a looped drone. Silver says, ‘there is no time here, not any more’.

(…) Hammond said that he had not necessarily intended the series to end there. He had thought that it would be rested, to return at some point in the future. There would be no return – at least, not on network television.

(…) Eternally suspended, never to be freed, their plight – and indeed their provenance – never to be fully explained, Sapphire and Steel’s internment in this café from nowhere prophetic for a general condition: in which life continues, but time has somehow stopped.

There are relations between department store and museum, and here the bazaar provides a link. The amassing of artworks in the museum brings them into communication with commodities, which - where they offer themselves en masse to the passerby - awake in him the notion that some part of this should fall to him as well.

The result might seem counterintuitive. Indeed, Hewstone told me, other academic experts thought their conclusions were “bonkers”. But as a disciple of Tajfel, Hewstone had always recognised the centrality of group membership to identity. These days, his findings are widely accepted: for group prejudice to be eroded, group identity has to be maintained. In other words, contact itself is not enough.

Positive contact between members of antagonistic groups will improve how members of these groups generally see each other only if the people involved are seen as representative of their group. For contact to work, one does not want to put individuals through some kind of identity blender, to produce a homogeneous group. The aim is that people can see other people precisely as “other” and then realise that other isn’t bad.

Modesty, thrift and restraint – the key bourgeois values – were to be encouraged, though recidivists would lapse into ‘a blaze of colour’. Philanthropic landlords with model estates, or paternalist industrialists like Cadbury at Bournville, where the gardens were generously supplied with the shrubs and flowers, were relentless in their rules and regulations, as were the enlightened municipal authorities that were then building the first council houses. On the Wythenshawe estate in Manchester ‘slum habits’, such as putting up a trellis for unruly sweet peas too close to the path, could land you in trouble. The lower orders soon learned to police themselves.

Middlesex Street, ‘Petticoat Lane’, is full of public housing, from interwar tenements to a remarkable mini-Barbican of walkways and towers. It’s a sudden plunge right into real London, and vies with Poplar for the sharpest meeting of rich and poor in Europe. These places were largely owned by the LCC, now Tower Hamlets, and hence are left to rot. The City’s own postwar housing projects, however, are still a revelation. It’s incredible at this distance to think that the City could have paid for Golden Lane, for instance, a place where evidently some of London’s working class manage to live well next to architects who are paying over the odds for the same flats. The Barbican, into which it imperceptibly fades along Goswell Lane, is a more complicated proposition, never public housing in the strict sense, although certainly not intended as the luxury enclave it is now. The Barbican, aside from the sheer pleasure of its Brutalist-Baroque grandeur, is mainly of use for deflecting every anti-modernist, anti-urban shibboleth going – a high density arrangement of towers and walkways, without an inch of ‘defensible space’, in beefy raw concrete, that is doing very well thank you (it’s also, like the City itself, a wonderful place to get yourself deliberately lost on a Sunday).

Joining the evangelists on these routes across Asia were military leaders, merchants and learned men. Modern Chinese words derived from Persian and Arabic, such as bosi, meaning a precious object (literally “from Persia”), are evidence of the booming markets and wealth in the Muslim world in the early Middle Ages, as vast tax revenues flowed towards Baghdad and the great cities of Mesopotamia and central Asia. Scholars were drawn by systems of patronage that gathered the best minds to work on pure and applied mathematics, science, optics and medicine, while great craftsmen found an insatiable demand for their wares. A place such as Rayy, not far from modern Tehran, was so glorious as to be considered “the bridegroom of the earth”. Cities, strung like pearls across the spine of Asia, flourished long after the discovery of the Americas: the moment usually presumed to have marked the true start of the ascent of the West.

Calvert drew most of the pictograms in the friendly, curvaceous style of Transport. Many of her illustrations were inspired by aspects of her own life. The cow featured in the triangular sign warning drivers to watch out for farm animals on the road was based on Patience, a cow on her relatives’ Warwickshire farm. Eager to make the school children crossing sign more accessible, she replaced the image of a boy in a school cap leading a little girl, with one of a girl – modelled on a photograph of herself as a child – with a younger boy. Calvert described the old sign as being: “quite archaic, almost like an illustration from Enid Blyton… I wanted to make it more inclusive because comprehensives were starting up.”
